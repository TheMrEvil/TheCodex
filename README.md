----how to use----

press = (+ on numpad)
going into or out of a run removes all pages so you have to add them after entering a run

----disclaimer----

multiplayer does work for now, however pages/loadouts are public to everyone in the lobby and if you abuse this in lobbies with people who dont want you using this mod you are liable to be banned, ALWAYS ask for permission from everyone you are playing with before using this mod.
